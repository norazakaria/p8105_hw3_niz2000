# Problem 1

## Load the Instacart Dataset
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

```
The Instacart dataset consists of 1,384,617 observations and 17 different variables relating to instacart orders. Key variables include the order_id, product_id, reordered, days_since_prior_order, product_name, and the department. Using the dataset, you can determine information about specific ordering behavior for an individual. For example, order identifier 1 (order_id) ordered product number 49302 (product_id=49302) Bulgarian Yogurt (product_name) from the dairy eggs department (department), and reordered the product an additional time (reordered). Order identifier 36 (order_id) ordered water seltzer sparkling water (product_name) from the beverages department (department), 7 days after their last instacart order (days_since_prior_order).
